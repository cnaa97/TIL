## Why do I start to write TIL

Natually, I feel the need to customize what I learned a few years ago. I studied not only front-end development, but also other web technology. When I need to code like CSS or I can't remember some kine of code exactly, I can find on my note storage and search with keywords. Day by day, my notes is getting more and more.

## Why do I choose Github and Gitbook

I used many note editing service like evernote, simplenote, and the bear app. Occasionally, I moved to another service with any reason, and My last choise is the bear app.

Until May 2018, I arranged all of what I learned on bear app. For over two years, many materials I can see. But documents are only stored on my private storage. I want to publish my record on web. So, I need to find other useful solution. I choose a Gitbook with integrated Github. You can see all of my note on this [Wiki](https://docs.junojunho.com/til).
